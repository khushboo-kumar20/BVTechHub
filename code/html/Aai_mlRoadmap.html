              topics&#128293; in the software engineering world today.
              Regardless of how long you’ve been in the industry, or indeed if
              you’re coming to programming from a completely different field,
              not only can a basic foundation in AI and Machine Learning help
              you advance your career, but also open your mind to different ways
              of solving problems, beyond the algorithmic realm.</span

              >There’s never been a better time to jump into it. The
              internet&#128187; is full of tutorials, frameworks, and
              experiments one can run to get familiar with this discipline. You
              no longer need to read complex research papers and have a solid
              foundation in mathematics to get going. Just follow some courses
              and tutorials and you’re on your way. Artificial Intelligence is a
              buzzword today, although this term is not new. The goal of
              Artificial Intelligence is to aid human capabilities and help us
              make advanced decisions with far-reaching consequences🌈. From a
              technical standpoint, that is the main goal of AI🌟.</span

              ><b>&#128204; Machine Learning:</b> Machine learning is the art of
              studying algorithms that learn from examples and experiences.
              Machine learning is based on the idea that some patterns in the
              data were identified and used for future predictions. The
              difference from hardcoding rules is that the machine learns to
              find such rules.

              ><b>&#128204; Deep Learning:</b> Deep learning is a sub-field of
              machine learning. Deep learning does not mean the machine learns
              more in-depth knowledge; it uses different layers to learn from
              the data. The depth of the model is represented by the number of
              layers in the model. For instance, the Google LeNet model for
              image recognition counts 22 layers.
            </span>
            <span
              ><b>&#128204; Natural Language Processing:</b> A neural network is
              a group of connected I/O units where each connection has a weight
              associated with its computer programs. It helps you to build
              predictive models from large databases. This model builds upon the
              human nervous system. You can use this model to conduct image
              understanding, human learning, computer speech, etc.

              that uses facts and heuristics to solve complex decision-making
              problems. It is also considered at the highest level of human
              intelligence. The main goal of an expert system is to solve the
              most complex issues in a specific domain.

          <h3>🤖 Step 1: Pick a programming language & Get Started!</h3>
          <p>
            The first step to start learning machine learning is to pick up a
            programming language. There are different programming languages in
            the market, but the most suitable for machine learning are Python
            and R. Recommended is Python. Why? Because its popular, easy to
            learn and future-ready. With Python, you can switch domains easily.
            Python offers popular frameworks like Django and Flask for backend
            development, Tkinter for GUI development, Pygames for Game
            development, etc. If you go with Python, you must learn sklearn for
            Machine Learning. Sklearn is a modern machine learning library
            written in Python. The best thing about sklearn is that most of the
            Machine learning algorithms are written for you already. It has a
            lot of useful classes for preprocessing your data for further
            analysis You should also look into the Tensorflow module, which can
            help you build a neural network without many efforts!
          </p>
          <h3>🤖 Step 2: Learn Linear Algebra</h3>
          <p>
            You should learn Linear Algebra if you wish to master Machine
            Learning and become a pro! This is essential because if you want to
            tune your models with maximum flexibility, you need to know how they
            work, and knowing linear algebra is a must for that! When you start,
            you should focus on Step 1, and while you are following step 1, you
            can begin learning Linear Algebra parallelly. You start two similar
            things parallelly, focusing on the first and keeping relatively less
            priority on the other tasks. This can help you keep the enthusiasm
            and the motivation up.
          </p>
          <h3>🤖 Step 3: Learn Statistics</h3>
          <p>
            Having a basic understanding of probability and statistics is
            important when it comes to mastering Machine Learning.
          </p>
          <h3>🤖 Step 4: Learn Core ML Algorithms</h3>
          <p>
            Once you have some idea of using sklearn after learning python, you
            should start looking into how these machine learning algorithms
            work. While using sklearn, an ML Algorithm is a black box written by
            the sklearn developers. In order to get an idea of how these Machine
            learning algorithms work from within, look into: Gradient Descent
            Slope Supervised vs Unsupervised learning Reinforcement Learning
            Basic Linear Regression Working of all such similar models
            Clustering.
          </p>
          <h3>🤖 Step 5: Learn Python Libraries</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Learn Numpy</li>
            <li>Learn Pandas</li>
            <li>All this will be helpful to debug the python/sklearn code</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>🤖 Step 6: Learn Deployment</h3>
          <p>
            To host your machine learning models with a powerful backend, you
            will need to learn frameworks like Django and Flask. Docker and
            Kubernetes can be of great help if you want to ship and deploy your
            models quickly! Streamlit is worthy of looking into if you wish to
            build custom web apps for machine learning and data science.
