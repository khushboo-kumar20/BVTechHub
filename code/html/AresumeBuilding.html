        <div>
            <p id="intro">According to a report published by Forbes on top, “10 reasons qualified applicants to get rejected for a job interview”, the top reasons for entry-level developers are mistakes in their resumes.</p>
            <p id="intro">Well, search no more: We’ve compiled all the resume tips you need into one place. Read on for advice and tricks that’ll make sure you craft a winning resume!</p>

            <div>
                <h3>1) <u>Customizing Resume</u></h3>
                <p>The most common mistakes everyone makes while writing a resume is to not customizing it as per the job requirements. It definitely requires extra time, but it is worth it. If you are applying for the role of Java Developer, and your resume does not contain your proficiency in Java then you are most likely to get rejected straight away</p>
                <h3>2) <u>Name the file smartly</u></h3>
                <p>A lot of student make the mistake of not naming the file correctly. The best file name is the name of the student followed by the roll number or job title and course with branch in brackets.<br>For example: <i>Mariana_Napolitiani_19122_BTech(IT)</i></p>
                <h3>3) <u>Keep it to a page!</u></h3>
                <p>The two- (or more!) page resume is a hotly debated topic, but the bottom line is this—you want the information here to be concise, and making yourself keep it to one page is a good way to force yourself to do this. If you truly have enough relevant and important experience, training, and credentials to showcase on more than one page of your resume, then go for it. But if you can tell the same story in less space? Do. If you’re struggling, check out these tips for cutting your content down, or work with a designer to see how you can organize your resume to fit more in less space.</p>
                <h3>4) <u>Keep it Reverse Chronological</u></h3>
                <p>There are lots of different ways to organize the information on your resume—like the functional resume or combination resume—but the good old reverse chronological (where your most recent experience is listed first) is still your best bet.</p>
                <h3>5) <u>Don’t put everything on the resume</u></h3>
                <p>Your resume should not have every work experience you have ever had listed on it. Think of your resume not as a comprehensive list of your career history, but as a marketing document selling you as the perfect person for the job. For each resume you send out, you’ll want to highlight only the accomplishments and skills that are most relevant to the job at hand (even if that means you don’t include all of your experience). </p>
                <h3>6) <u>Keep it simple</u></h3>
                <p>Use a basic but modern font, like Helvetia, Ariel, or Century Gothic. Make your resume easy on hiring managers’ eyes by using a font size between 10 and 12 and leaving a healthy amount of white space on the page. You can use a different font or typeface for your name, your resume headers, and the companies for which you’ve worked, but keep it simple and keep it consistent. No matter what resume format you choose, your main focus here should be on readability for the hiring manager.</p>
                <h3>7) <u>Make contact information prominent</u></h3>
                <p>The contact information, professional email address <i>(College email id must not be used or mentioned since it gets disabled once you graduate). </i>LinkedIn profile, GitHub profile Et cetera must be mentioned.</p>
                <h3>8) <u>Curate your bullet points</u></h3>
                <p>Your goal is to stand out among the other dozens of people who are applying for the same job and who, presumably, have similar experience. That means your bullets should read something like, “presented with Unsung Hero award for behind-the-scenes contributions to annual conference,” or “increased number of conference attendees by 20%,” not “responsible for conference logistics.”</p>
                <p>No section should have seven to nine bullet points! The recruiter doesn't have this much time to go through all of them hence the best approach would be mentioning the most important and relevant ones.</p>
                <h3>9) <u>No Relevant Experience? No Worries!</u></h3>
                <p>Don’t panic if you don’t have any experience that fits the bill. Instead, focus your resume on your relevant and transferrable skills along with any related side or academic projects. Projects put up a lot of effective impact and remember you can always the shift the focus of the interviewer by making right choices and highlighting strong portions on your resume.</p>
                <h3>10) <u>Don’t Neglect Non-Traditional Work</u></h3>
                <p>There’s no law that says you can not put extracurricular and society work on your resume,and especially the students of B.Tech yet have any job experiences. So, if you have participated in a major volunteer role, worked part-time in some <abbr title="Non-Profit Organizations ">NGO</abbr>, were hired as a temporary or contract worker or campus representative, did <abbr title="Model United Nations">MUN</abbr>s, or blogged. Absolutely list these things as their own “Experiences” or "Extracurricular" within your career chronology</p>
                <h3>11) <u>List Out Your Skills</u></h3>
                <p>Be sure to add a section that lists out all the relevant skills you have for a position, including tech skills like HTML and CSS, Et cetera and any industry-related or valid certifications. Just make sure to skip including skills that everyone is expected to have, <i>like using email</i>. Doing so will actually make a bad impact. Hence include all the important and strong skills(especially for <i>Computer Science and Information Technology</i> students).</p>
                <h3>12) <u>Project</u></h3>
                <p>A major question among the third year Bachelors of Technology undergrads are that what should we do when we don't have any project?<br> A very simple answer to this is, "Don't worry". Even the hiring company knows that students won't be having projects or that much experience. Hence, do not panic over it but yes if you happen to have a project then it will put up a lot of good impact and the cards will be in your favor as you'll stand out among the crowd!</p>
                <h3>13) <u>Picture on your Resume</u></h3>
                <p>Remember it's not your social media account so don't put up a picture that is not in a professional clothes or from side angles. Also remember that the hairs are neatly done, dress is formal and appropriate and most importantly, the size of the picture. The picture must be of passport size and also a recent one! Don't put up a very old picture shocking the interviewer on the interview day!</p>
                <h3>14) <u>Show Some Personality</u></h3>
                <p>Feel free to include an “Interests” section on your resume, but only add those that are relevant to the job</p>
                <h3>15) <u>Constantly Refresh It</u></h3>
                <p>When your resume is updated on a regular basis, you’re ready to pounce when opportunity presents itself. Hence crave out some time to brush up on your usage of words and framing of sentences as well as adding and updating information (if there's any changes).</p>
